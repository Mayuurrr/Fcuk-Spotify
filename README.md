# Fcuk-Spotify üéµ

Fcuk-Spotify is a fully functional Spotify clone built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates the core features of a music streaming service like Spotify, enabling users to interact with music tracks, playlists, and media controls in a seamless, modern interface. The app provides a smooth user experience, complete with music playback functionality, dynamic album art, and responsive design, making it adaptable across different devices and screen sizes.

## üåü Key Features

- **Play/Pause Functionality**: Play or pause any selected track.
- **Next/Previous Track Navigation**: Skip to the next or previous song in the queue.
- **Responsive UI Design**: Designed to work well across both desktop and mobile screens with fluid layout transitions.
- **Real-time Music Progress**: See the current timestamp and duration of the song as it plays.
- **Dynamic Playlist**: Add and manage tracks within a playlist.
- **Album Art Display**: Displays the album cover of the currently playing song.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume with a slider.
- **Track Seek Functionality**: Skip to any part of the song by interacting with the progress bar.
- **Modern Aesthetic Design**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and a clean, minimalist design.

## üìö How it Works

This clone leverages fundamental web technologies to mimic the basic functionalities of a real music streaming application:

- **HTML5**: Structures the overall content, including song lists, controls, and album display.
- **CSS3**: Provides the visual layout, making the UI both stylish and responsive for a seamless user experience on various devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers the interactivity and logic behind the app, such as playing audio, updating the UI in real-time, and controlling playback settings.

All song metadata (album art, song title, artist, and duration) is loaded dynamically, while media control features are managed with JavaScript‚Äôs `Audio()` API.
